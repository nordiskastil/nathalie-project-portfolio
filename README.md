# Portfolio

- Build a portfolio using React displaying the following for each project:
Project name
Project image
All tags (e.g. HTML5, CSS3)
Link/button to Netlify & GitHub

- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
I started looking att the book library assignment and then created a simular structure using the information from data.json. I added a map called: components containing all the components as seperat .jsx files. Than I created som images from of the projects and added them to the assets map, I also added a portrait image. The next step was to connect the seperat files with App.jsx and Main.jsx. Then I added HTML & CSS code to make the site look good. 
- If you had more time, what would be next?
I already spend a lot of time on this assignment, but I probably would make it more interactive.
